## Overview

Aeris is an air quality monitoring dashboard created for the **2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge**. It transforms complex atmospheric data into actionable insights, helping **outdoor athletes** and **individuals with respiratory conditions** (asthma, COPD, allergies) make informed decisions about outdoor activities and health precautions. Built with React and Leaflet.js, Aeris provides real-time air quality measurements, historical trends, and AI-powered forecasts through an intuitive map-based interface.
